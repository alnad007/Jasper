# Assessment
## Overview

Brief overview of the project, its purpose, and technologies used.

## Getting Started
In this Project I created deployed hello.world serverless using Lambda functions. 
For Infrastructure I used terraform.
For CICD I used Github Actions
we can access the hello world by using the end point Generated by API Gateway
To deploy this test application in  your Environment you only need to add:
AWS ACCESS KEY 
AWS SECRET KEY
AWS REGION
in the repo settings in secrets portion. and add the variable name in GITUB ACTION main.yml file.
then when you commint it will start deploying.
if you encountered any issues you can check the GITHUB ACTIONS logs.
Thank you
